    <p>Came in for a quick bite to eat before a photo shoot. The woman who took our order greeted us the moment we walked in. A very big and happy personality.  Such a welcoming presence in this place.  Food came out nice and hot. We had fry sauce and food was great. I was impressed by the size of this place. It‚Äôs really big and really clean. The staff treat the young guests very well also as I was watching while i waited for my food. Inside they have two separate counters. One for the pho diners and another towards the back for the Herfy‚Äôs diners.  Definitely stop by and visit because you‚Äôll feel welcomed here and the food is good!</p>
    <p>Loved our experience here. Made our decision based on the variety of options. Food was SO GOOD and we travel to eat & try new foods often. The burgers are HERFY but way better than any location I've been to in tacoma-oly. Price for what we got was more than fair. The lady who was behind the counter was beyond welcoming. She gave us suggestions, entertained my little one, and brought us a box for our food before we had to ask. Wish we didnt live so far but we will be back. Thank you lady. You made our day. Sorry, no photos we enjoyed our food.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôve come here quite a few times.  The food is wonderful. My favorite is anything with the Bulgogi sandwich I would have taken a picture but I ate too quickly. Everyone is super friendly.</p>
